-- Comparison Operators --
They are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values.
They return true or false.
 ==     means equal to
 ===    is strictly equal to
 !=     not equal to
 !==    strictly not equal to


-- Logical Operators --
 These include:
    &&  stands for 'and'
    ||  stands for 'or'
    !   stands for 'not'

    &&  returns a 'true' value only when both operands are 'true'
    ||  returns a 'true' value when either of the operands is 'true'

-- Type Operators --
- typeof operator: operates on a single operand. Returns the datatype of the operand
- instanceof operator: operates on two operands. It is used in between its two operands.

-- in operator --
The 'in' operator checks if a variable contains a particular value

-- Conditional (Ternary) Operator --
This first evaluates an expression for a true or false value and then executes one of the two
statements that corresponds to the evaluation.
Usually, the first value corresponds to a true value while the false value is the last after the colon (:)

1   2   4   8   16  32  64  128

128 64  32  16  8   4   2   1

-- Bitwise Operator --
Works on two operands.
First, it converts each of the operands to base 2.
Then compares the base two values leaving it in base 2.
Lastly, converts the result back to base 10.
