-- Objects & (Arrays) --
JavaScript variables are containers used to store values or data

A JavaScript object is a special variable that contains several variables
It is advisable to use the 'const' keyword in creating an object and put the different attributes in curly braces
Objects contain key-value pairs e.g.

const John ={
    name: "John",
    weight: 50kg,
    hobbies: "sleeping", "coding",
}

remember to end every key-value pair with a comma.

To console.log() specific attributes of an object,
we can either use the dot notation or the bracket notation.
For instance, 'objectname.attribute' or 'objectname["attribute"]'

To console.log() an attribute of an object, where the attribute is an array,
we can either use the dot notation or the bracket notation.
For instance, 'objectname.attribute[attribute_index]' or 'objectname["attribute"][attribute_index]'


--- Methods ---
Methods are functions that are passed in an object.
Therefore, in an object, while a attribute or key takes up a value,
a Method takes in a function as value.
Methods are stored in objects as function properties
