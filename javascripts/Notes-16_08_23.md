-- The Switch statement
The interpreter checks each case against the value of the expression until a match is found.
If nothing matches, a default condition will be used
syntax:
switch(expression)
{
    case condition 1: statement(s)
        break;
    case condition 2: statement(s)
        break;
    ...
    case condition n: statement(s)
        break;
    default: statement(s)
}

The break statements indicate the end of a particular case. If they were omittd,
the interpreter would continue executing each statement in each of the following cases


-- Control Flow (Loops)
Loops with an operand(Label)
syntax

parentloop: 
    for(){
        childloop:
            for(){
                codes to be executed
                break parentloop
            }
    }
